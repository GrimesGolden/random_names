# random_names
Create random names for use in a video game such as Starfield. 

The purpose of this program is to generate humorous and provocotive user names for use in a video game.
Most skirt the limits of many name conventions, some may not.
Due to the psuedo-random nature of this program, I recommend using the program in this manner.
Generate a list of 100-200 or more names, then search through it for your favourite and copy them down.
Then generate more, rinse and repeat.

In fact I would further modify this program in the following way. 

The user can add a list of chosen names to the program, "good names" if the name is already on that list it will generate again until it finds an "original name".
In this way the user can perfect his choices continuously.
